Setup: (temp readme)

1. Install makefile plugin to run makefile files (if you already not have one)
2. Go to benchmark folder and tun the command:
```
make setup
```
This command will create a virtual env and install the dependencies with no conflicts. 
Important to say that this virtual env uses python 3.12, so ensure you have this version of python in your machine
